2.045 2016-01-24

  This release fix a limitation of "cme edit lcdproc". User can now
  enable more than one driver (i.e. set lirc and imonlcd drivers)
  (this requires Config::Model 2.076)

2.044 2016-01-02

  * Fix pod documentation re-generation which broke smoke tests on solaris.

2.043 2015-12-31

  Bug fix release to cope with a change on Config::Model::Iself.
  The scripts used to generate lcdproc model will now complain in case of
  issue:
    * gen_LCDd_model: use new cm_lib_dir param (Debian #808853)
    * require Config::Model::Itself >= 2.001
    * Build.PL: exit 1 when model generation fails
    * gen_LCDd_model: exit 1 when model generation fails

  The model generator changes are:
    * specs specified between {...} can override specs specified between [...].
      New syntax : {% and %}
    * specify value type in all cases
    * handle specs between [ and ] that span several lines

  In case of issue, please now use github bug tracker:

2.042 2014-05-25

    The lcdproc model of this release is made for ldcproc 0.5.7. Only a very
    small modification of LCDd.conf comments was required to be able to
    generate a complete lcdproc model from LCDd.conf.

    Changes:
    * Build.PL: run script/gen_LCDd_model.pl at build time
    * AnyEvent is no longer needed in tests
    * LCDd.conf: modified comment to avoid Device being interpreted as list ...
    * lcdconf2model: improved parsing of legal spec from LCDd.conf comments

2.041 2014-01-24

    * require perl 5.10 (like Config::Model)

    * LCDd model generator:
      * off,on values are now boolean. cme will be more tolerant on
        input values (e.g. 'no' will be converted to 'off')
      * removed [.*] from generated doc of LCDd configuration elements

2.040 2013-09-22

    * LCDd.conf v0.5.6 patches:
	  * Specify yes/no as legal values for Foreground (so it becomes a boolean)
      * specify ReportLevel default value is square brackets

    * LCDd model generator:
      * yes,no values are now boolean (requires Config::Model 2.043)
      * ignore default value from file when square brackets are specified
      * don't initialise Hello and GoodBye arrays
      * default value mentioned in square brackets are used as upstream_default
      * tweak model to ensure that DriverPath will end with a slash

    * test upgrade from original lcdproc config file with 0.5.5 and 0.5.6

2.039 2013-06-19

    * model_test.t: avoid warnings in smoke tests
    * updated doc
    * model generator: fixed comments
    * model generator: updated (c) years

0.001 2013-06-15

    * imported LCDd.conf from lcdproc 0.5.6
    * LCDd.conf: removed extra comment that trips model generation
