This directory contains a slightly modified version of the LCDd.conf
file provided by lcdproc project. See http://www.lcdproc.org/

The modification are mostly typo fix in comments which are parsed
by lcdconf2model to generate LCDd model.

Eventually, Config::Model::LcdProc will not need its version of LCDd.conf.
